## Recognition

Primary recognition goes to Stephen Frost for all his valuable advice and criticism during the development of pgBackRest.

[Crunchy Data](http://www.crunchydata.com) has contributed significant time and resources to pgBackRest and continues to actively support development. [Resonate](http://www.resonate.com) also contributed to the development of pgBackRest and allowed early (but well tested) versions to be installed as their primary PostgreSQL backup solution.
