    <description>The {[project]} Releases detail each version of the software and lists the changes made in each version.</description>

    <intro>
        <text><backrest/> release numbers consist of two parts, major and minor.  A major release may break compatibility with the prior major release, for instance the 1.XX releases are not compatible with the 0.XX releases.  Minor releases can include bug fixes and features but do not change the interface, naming, or the repository format.

        The notes for a release may also contain <quote>Additional Notes</quote> but changes in the this section are only to documentation and the test suite and have no impact the on the <backrest/> codebase.</text>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where db-path was not required for the <cmd>check</cmd> command so an assert was thrown when it was missing rather than a polite error message.</p>

                        </release-item-contributor-list>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where <id>keep-alives</id> could be starved out by lots of small files during multi-threaded <cmd>backup</cmd>.  They were also completely absent from single/multi-threaded <cmd>backup</cmd> resume and <cmd>restore</cmd> checksumming.</p>
                    </release-item>

                        </release-item-contributor-list>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where the <cmd>expire</cmd> command would refuse to run when explicitly called from the command line if the <br-option>db-host</br-option> option was set.  This was not an issue when <cmd>expire</cmd> was run automatically after a <cmd>backup</cmd></p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed an issue where validation was being running on <pg-setting>archive_command</pg-setting> even when the <br-option>archive-check</br-option> option was disabled.</p>

                        <p>Added <cmd>check</cmd> command to validate that <backrest/> is configured correctly for archiving and backups.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Added the <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option> option.  Previously <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option> was set as <br-option>db-timeout</br-option> + 30 seconds.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Failure to shutdown remotes at the end of the backup no longer throws an exception.  Instead a warning is generated that recommends a higher <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option>.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Experimental support for non-exclusive backups in <postgres/> 9.6 beta2.  Changes to the control/catalog/WAL versions in subsequent betas may break compatibility but <backrest/> will be updated with each release to keep pace.</p>
                    </release-item>
                </release-feature-list>

                <release-refactor-list>
                    <release-item>
                        <p>The <code>pg_xlogfile_name()</code> function is no longer used to construct WAL filenames from LSNs. While this function is convenient it is not available on a standby.  Instead, the archive is searched for the LSN in order to find the timeline.  If due to some misadventure the LSN appears on multiple timelines then an error will be thrown, whereas before this condition would have passed unnoticed.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Option handling is now far more strict.  Previously it was possible for a command to use an option that was not explicitly assigned to it.  This was especially true for the <br-option>backup-host</br-option> and <br-option>db-host</br-option> options which are used to determine locality.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Improved handling of users/groups captured during backup that do not exist on the restore host.  Also explicitly handle the case where user/group is not mapped to a name.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Changed version variable to a constant.  It had originally been designed to play nice with a specific packaging tool but that tool was never used.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed DTD search path that did not work properly when <setting>--doc-path</setting> was used.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed <backrest/>-specific xml that was loaded for non-<backrest/> projects.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed section names being repeated in the info output when multiple <br-option>--require</br-option> options depended on the same sections.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed <backrest/> config sections being blank in the output when not loaded from cache.</p>

                 <release-feature-list>
                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow hidden options to be added to a command.  This allows certain commands (like <id>apt-get</id>) to be forced during the build without making that a part of the documentation.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow command summaries to be inserted anywhere in the documentation to avoid duplication.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow a static date to be used for documentation to generate reproducible builds.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Update TeX Live to 2016 version.</p>

                 <release-refactor-list>

                        <p>Recommended install location for <backrest/> modules is now <path>/usr/share/perl5</path> since <path>/usr/lib/perl5</path> has been removed from the search path in newer versions of Perl.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>

                        <p>Major refactor of the test suite to make it more modular and object-oriented.  Multiple Docker containers can now be created for a single test to simulate more realistic environments.  Tests paths have been renamed for clarity.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Greatly reduced the quantity of Docker containers built by default.  Containers are only built for <postgres/> versions specified in <id>db-minimal</id> and those required to build documentation. Additional containers can be built with <br-option>--db-version=all</br-option> or by specifying a version, e.g. <br-option>--db-version=9.4</br-option>.</p>

             <release-core-list>
                 <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This flag day release breaks compatibility with older versions of <backrest/>.  The manifest format, on-disk structure, configuration scheme, and the exe/path names have all changed.  You must create a new repository to hold backups for this version of <backrest/> and keep your older repository for a time in case you need to do a restore.  Restores from the prior repository will require the prior version of <backrest/> but because of name changes it is possible to have <id>1.00</id> and a prior version of <backrest/> installed at the same time.  See the notes below for more detailed information on what has changed.</p>

                        <p>Implemented a new configuration scheme which should be far simpler to use.  See the User Guide and Configuration Reference for details but for a simple configuration all options can now be placed in the <setting>stanza</setting> section. Options that are shared between stanzas can be placed in the <setting>[global]</setting> section.  More complex configurations can still make use of command sections though this should be a rare use case.</p>

The new <setting>spool-path</setting> option can be used to define a location for queueing WAL segments when archiving asynchronously.  A local repository is no longer required.</p>

            <release-core-list>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT BUG FIX FOR TABLESPACES</b>: A change to the repository format was accidentally introduced in 0.90 which means the on-disk backup was no longer a valid <postgres/> cluster when the backup contained tablespaces.  This only affected users who directly copied the backups to restore <postgres/> clusters rather than using the restore command.  However, the fix breaks compatibility with older backups that contain tablespaces no matter how they are being restored (<backrest/> will throw errors and refuse to restore).  New full backups should be taken immediately after installing version 0.91 for any clusters that contain tablespaces.  If older backups need to be restored then use a version of <backrest/> that matches the backup version.</p>

                        <p>When backing up and restoring tablespaces <backrest/> only operates on the subdirectory created for the version of <postgres/> being run against.

This only applies to <postgres/> >= 9.0 &amp;mdash; prior versions of <postgres/> could not share a tablespace directory.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed a buffering error that could occur on large, highly-compressible files when copying to an uncompressed remote destination.  The error was detected in the decompression code and resulted in a failed backup rather than corruption so it should not affect successful backups made with previous versions.</p>

                        <p>Fixed broken checksums and now they work with normal and resumed backups.  Finally realized that checksums and checksum deltas should be functionally separated and this simplified a number of things.  Issue #28 has been created for checksum deltas.</p>

                        <p>Added option <setting>{[dash]}-no-start-stop</setting> to allow backups when Postgres is shut down.  If <file>postmaster.pid</file> is present then <setting>{[dash]}-force</setting> is required to make the backup run (though if Postgres is running an inconsistent backup will likely be created).  This option was added primarily for the purpose of unit testing, but there may be applications in the real world as well.</p>

                        <p>Found and squashed a nasty bug where <code>file_copy()</code> was defaulted to ignore errors.  There was also an issue in <code>file_exists()</code> that was causing the test to fail when the file actually did exist.  Together they could have resulted in a corrupt backup with no errors, though it is very unlikely.</p>

                        <p>Worked on improving error handling in the <code>File</code> object.  This is not complete, but works well enough to find a few errors that have been causing us problems (notably, find is occasionally failing building the archive async manifest when system is under load).</p>

There's a good fix for that coming, but for the time being it has been changed to a warning so processing can continue.  This was impacting backups as sometimes the final archive file would not get pushed if the first archive file had been in a different directory (plus some bad luck).</p>

                        <p>No restore functionality, but the backup directories are consistent <postgres/> data directories.  You'll need to either uncompress the files or turn off compression in the backup.  Uncompressed backups on a ZFS (or similar) filesystem are a good option because backups can be restored locally via a snapshot to create logical backups or do spot data recovery.</p>

                        <p>Archiving is single-threaded.  This has not posed an issue on our multi-terabyte databases with heavy write volume.  Recommend a large WAL volume or to use the async option with a large volume nearby.</p>

                        <p>Backups are multi-threaded, but the <code>Net::OpenSSH</code> library does not appear to be 100% thread-safe so it will very occasionally lock up on a thread.  There is an overall process timeout that resolves this issue by killing the process.  Yes, very ugly.</p>
