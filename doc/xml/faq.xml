        <title>Can I use dots/periods in my S3 bucket name?</title>

        <p>The RFC does not allow wildcards to match on a dot (.), therefore s3 bucket names must not contain dots. If there are dots in the S3 bucket name then an error such as <quote>unable to find hostname 'my.backup.bucket.s3.amazonaws.com' in certificate common name or subject alternative names</quote> will occur.</p>
