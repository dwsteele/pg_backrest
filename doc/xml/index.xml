        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p><backrest/> aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases and workloads.</p>

        <p>Instead of relying on traditional backup tools like tar and rsync, <backrest/> implements all backup features internally and uses a custom protocol for communicating with remote systems.  Removing reliance on tar and rsync allows for better solutions to database-specific backup issues.  The custom remote protocol limits the types of connections that are required to perform a backup which increases security.</p>

        <title>Recognition</title>

        <p>Primary recognition goes to Stephen Frost for all his valuable advice and criticism during the development of <backrest/>.

        <link url="{[crunchy-url-base]}">Crunchy Data</link> has contributed significant time and resources to <backrest/> and continues to actively support development. <link url="{[resonate-url-base]}">Resonate</link> also contributed to the development of <backrest/> and allowed early (but well tested) versions to be installed as their primary <postgres/> backup solution.</p>
